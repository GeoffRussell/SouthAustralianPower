## Conclusions

On objective measures, nuclear power is [safer and more eco-friendly every regard](https://www.blog.geoffrussell.com.au/post/eu-sustainability-taxonomy-why-allow-solar-pv) and has long been [supported by a veritable who's who](https://bravenewclimate.com/2014/12/15/an-open-letter-to-environmentalists-on-nuclear-energy/)
of ecological and environmental scientists working in Australia and, ignoring roughly 20% undecided is supported
by a 2:1 majority of the Australian public, but is currently banned because of some extraordinary political 
manoevering in the late 1990s. So we are currently stuck using second rate environmentally sub-optimal 
energy sources that are not
dispatchable. In other jurisictions using wind and solar, forests are available to burn to firm
supply and rivers can be dammed (which should probably be spelled damned) for hydro-electricity. 
For example, Germany in 2022 got about 600 terawatt-hours (TWh) from burning forests, only slightly
below the 723 TWh it got from solar power. So SA is a very singular experiment.
