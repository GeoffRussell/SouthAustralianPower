This website (driven by [*shiny*](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/) software) will analyse the renewable energy
rollout in South Australia (SA). In the SA context, this means a wind and solar rollout. Why? Because
SA is one of the driest places on the planet, so it has virtually no rivers suitable for 
hydro-electricity, nor and forests it can burn. Consequently it is a natural experiment in variable renewable
resources and has more wind and solar power per person than pretty much anywhere on the planet. 

It's a real world experiment in non-trivial penetration of wind and solar power 
into an non-trivial grid. 

The SA grid is fairly small, serving about 1.7 million people, but big enough
to serve as a canary in a coal mine (bad pun intended). 

There are a number of public and private
organisations working together to operate Australia's grids. To keep things simple and to reduce acronyms, I'm going
to pretend that AEMO (the Australian Energy Market Operator) is responsible for everything and does everything. 

### SA offshoring coal emissions 

SA closed it's last coal plant in 2016.
