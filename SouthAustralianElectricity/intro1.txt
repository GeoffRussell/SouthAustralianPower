Germany is often regarded as the global renewable energy poster child, but the Australian state of South Australia (SA)
gets almost three times the electricity per person from wind and almost three times the electricity per person from 
solar. 

I live in SA and while we have a smaller population, at just 1.8 million people, our electricity grid is
non-trivial and big enough to serve as a model, or perhaps a warning, for others aspiring to a high penetration of
renewables.

"Renewables", in the SA context, means wind turbines and solar panels. This Australian state, over double the size of Germany, is one of the driest places on the planet. So, unlike Germany, we have virtually no forests we
can burn or rivers we can dam. 

Ours has been, and still is, a real world experiment in bolting high levels of wind and solar power 
onto a grid. We have enough solar panels feeding the grid at times that we need to centrally 
disconnect them. But on still, 40 degree C, nights we need over three gigawatts to be available to
run air conditioners.

In 2016, we had a statewide blackout that was intimately connected with our renewable energy rollout; and
getting the grid back up again wasn't quick or easy.

### The evolution of the SA grid

There are a number of public and private
organisations working together to operate Australia's grid(s). It's a veritable acronym jungle which isn't helped when
Governments sack organisations, rename them, or reallocate responsibilities from time to time. I'll try and keep things
as simple as possible, but no simpler.

SA closed it's last coal power plant in 2016.
