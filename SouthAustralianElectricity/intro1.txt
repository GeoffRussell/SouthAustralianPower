Germany is often regarded as the global renewable energy poster child, but the Australian state of South Australia (SA)
gets almost three times the electricity per person from wind and almost three times the electricity per person from 
solar. I live in SA and while we have a smaller population, at just 1.8 million people, our electricity grid is
non-trivial and big enough to serve as a model, or perhaps a warning, for others looking for a high penetration of
renewables.

Renewables, in the SA context, means wind turbines and solar panels. Unlike Germany, we have virtually no forests we
can burn or rivers we can dam. SA is one of the driest places on the planet.

It's a real world experiment in non-trivial penetration of wind and solar power 
into an non-trivial grid. 

We had a statewide blackout in 2016 which is intimately connected with our renewable energy rollout; and
getting the grid back up again wasn't quick or easy.

There are a number of public and private
organisations working together to operate Australia's grid(s). It's a veritable acronym jungle which isn't helped when
Governments sack organisations, rename them, or reallocate responsibilities from time to time.

SA closed it's last coal plant in 2016.
