### Background on the SA grid

The SA grid isn't massive by any standard, but
it isn't a toy. A [2023 AEMO study](https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/electricity/nem/security_and_reliability/congestion-information/sa-transition-to-fewer-synch-gen-grid-reference.pdf) (to be discussed later) looked at international "studies" of high penetration renewables and they are truly trivial. Calling them micro-grids would be a grandiose exaggeration. A few megawatts of wind or solar and some batteries; ho, hum. Every piece of research has to start this way, but it's simply ignorant and irresponsible for such
efforts to  be reported like they are global decarbonisation breakthrough.

SA on the other hand, is a [gigawatt scale grid](https://www.sapowernetworks.com.au/public/download.jsp?id=9716). 
It has 200,000 km of overhead cables, 77,000 transformers
and 400 zone substations spread over 178,000 square kilometers (the area of the state is 983,000 square kms).

Over the past 6 years, the *SA Power Networks* (the 
grid operating entity) has replaced
some 1,700 of the transformers.  

Why does that matter? 

Suppose we make changes to our electricity system requiring widespread
transformer upgrades, like adding so much rooftop PV that you overload
transformers, most of which are decades old. Suppose significant amounts of
power has to run backwards (away from houses and businesses) 
at levels never anticipated when the grid was
designed, then such a grid upgrade is going to take a while! Kudos to SA Power Networks who
are also upgrading the system to be more wildlife friendly; installing devices to reduce
the risks to flying foxes, in particular, of electrocution. 

The focus of our Australian Energy Minister Chris Bowen on the cost of generating
electricity is like the person ordering a toasted sandwhich on-line and
wondering why it costs so much. The cost of electricity is dominated by
the cost of delivery, not production. 

Break the grid and not only will decarbonisation be glacially slow, it will be incredibly expensive. 

## The evolution of the SA grid

A generous [feed in
tariff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed-in_tariffs_in_Australia#South_Australia)
was introduced into South Australia in 2006 with the then Premier Mike
Rann aiming for the state to be carbon neutral by 2020. And now, in 2023,
after 17 years of solar and wind installations, SA is a world leader in
per-person wind and solar electricity generation.

Australian's simply love to use the phrase "punching above our weight",
and we are. Not that we make the panels or the wind turbines or
even the batteries. We are pretty much, like the rest of the planet,
punching in the anorexic weight class of the renewable energy generation
manufacturing; but we are pretty good at buying it and plugging it in.

SA closed it's last coal power plant in 2016. 

Also in 2016, and not conincidentally, we 
had a statewide blackout; and
getting the grid back up again wasn't quick or easy. You can test a building evacuation from time to time
without too much fuss, but not so a statewide grid restart! And things which aren't tested have a habit of
failing, which it did. But this article isn't about the past, it's about the future; the steeply rising part
of that renewable energy expert chart above.

At the time the last coal power plant closed, we only had two. The
chart below lists the total output of the plants, but both Northern and
Playford B were composed of various smaller generators. A single large
power plant would create considerable risks in a small grid like ours.
