Germany is often regarded as the global renewable energy poster child,
but the Australian state of South Australia (SA) gets more than double
the electricity per person from wind and almost three times the
electricity per person from solar power than Germany. 

Many countries aspire to follow in Germany's footsteps despite the 
fact that it has been astonishingly unsuccessful in replacing fossil fuels
by wind and solar power during a solid and well funded 20 years of effort.

The following chart gives the per person low carbon electricity collected or generated for
various countries; including nuclear, solar, wind, hydro and biomass. I've included biomass (burning
forests as energy crops) despite there being considerable debate about it being low carbon without
sequestration of the resulting carbon dioxide; and despite the health problems associated with
wood smoke.  

The default selection is for Germany, Australia and the state of South 
Australia. You can select from another 20 countries that account for the bulk of the world's
energy use, population and greenhouse gas emissions. Hover over the chart and you can see 
the size of the components. You can also see how well we are travelling in terms of
meeting the International Energy Agency's 2050 targets. 

South Australia, and Australia as a whole has lessons for other countries on the
growing problem of *"renewable energy backlogs"*. Why do so many countries have a backlog
of wind and solar farms trying to connect to the grid? Is it just bureaucratic tape, or is there
an intrinsic problem that makes connecting to the grid much harder than, for example, plugging 
another device into a computer network.
