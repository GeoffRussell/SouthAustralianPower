You can see a summary board under the chart. 

Have a look at the night of the 24th of November. It was a *very* still night. Assuming you
have dialled in a doubling of wind+solar, the summary board shows
an accumulated shortfall over the night of 5,463, even with twice the renewables that we have now. Can
we fix that shortfall with storage?

### Alternative datasets 

The "Alternative datasets" button lists other weeks of data. At present I just have the dual heatwaves of 
2019 that delivered so much suffering in South Australia.

### Wind vs Demand 

There is a click box to show wind vs demand for the currently selected dataset. It may not "play well" with other
selections ... it won't show any Overbuild renewable generation if you have some selected.

### Fixing shortfalls with storage 

Now let's look at how storage can smooth the intermittency of wind and solar.

1. Click on the "Show Battery" tick box. The default battery is small, just 100MWh (the biggest battery
in the world in 2016). The battery in the model isn't a real one, it has no power limit, just an energy storage capacity. If you've followed the instructions this far, you'll see 4 times during the week when the battery 
is drained. It always begins the week full!

   Now set the "Battery size" to 1,600 MWh (about three times the battery storage currently in SA). Now there are just two times during the week when it is drained. 
   
   Since, at this stage we have no interconnectors in the model, a drained battery and not enough wind+solar, means we blackout. It's that simple; even though we have double the level of wind+solar that supplies 72 percent on average. 
   
2. Now click on the "Show dumped energy" tick box. You'll see about 160 GWh of electricity is dumped. Meaning we generated it, but even with 1,600 MWh of battery capacity we had to dump it. 

This web document details a variety of ways in which wind and solar will break the grid, meaning that
the most expensive part of our electricity supply will need to be significantly redesigned and rebuilt. But
it is interesting to think about how much electricity storage you will need to fix the shortfall. 


### What can you demonstrate with this kind of model? 

With a doubling of renewables, the shortfall on the night of 24th of November is considerable; 5,463 MWh. The summary
box shows the maximum power needed during the 8 hours; 340 MW.
Could you cover this particular shortfall with 16 batteries each with a maximum power output of 340MW and lasting
for 1 hour? That will depend on: 

1. exactly where you put them. They have to be fully charged at the start of the period and whether a battery
gets charged depends on where it is relative to any excess electricity which happens to be available. Grids, like
city streets can become congested.  

2. exactly where the power is required. Again, congestion has to be carefully modelled to make claims about what
is possible. 

In summary, the model I've built is more to give people a feel for the problems. A professional model would 
take the physical locations and capabilities into account of every piece of equipment. My little model shows what you **can't** do; you can't solve the problems posed by this still night of the 24th November with anything less than
5,463 MWh of storage, but it doesn't show how much more you will need than this to cover real world complexity.


## Concluding remarks

A large electricity grid is an astonishing creation requiring a considerable set of skills from a large set
of teams. Australia has stumbled into its decision to try and build a 100% renewable system as a direct consequence
of not looking seriously at the alternative; namely, leaving the grid substantially alone and just swap out the
thermal coal plants of thermal nuclear plants.

The decision to not consider nuclear seriously is partly the fault of the nuclear industry itself. It never 
really came to grips with the improved understanding of cancer that was emerging in the 1980s and is still
developing. How bizarre is it that you can walk into supermarkets and bottleshops anywhere in Australia and
buy potent carcinogenic foodstuffs, but we ban nuclear power? 

Anybody over 50 in Australia can get a [free bowel cancer screening kit](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/national-bowel-cancer-screening-program). You get a little booklet which tells you:

> *"People who smoke, are overweight, have a diet low in fresh vegetables and fruit, and high in red and processed meats, are at increased risk of **several cancers**" [emphasis added]

That's about as good an example as you get of bolting the stable door a couple of decades after the horses have left.

We have a myriad of organisations in Australia whose hands and lips are arc-welded to 
both traditional anti-nuclear policies and traditional cancer causing foods; giving us a position near the
top of the per person global cancer tables. 

The idea that a plane could fly into a nuclear plant and unleash a disaster
is a given for these groups and, I suspect, for the industry itself. 

But could any such accident rival the cancer impacts of alcohol, red and processed 
meat and tobacco? Impossible. The death toll from flying a plane into an office block would be
considerably higher, so why don't we demand they be safe in the face of such attacks? Because that would stop the
office block building in its tracks. The biggest impact of a successful attack on a nuclear plant has always
been the direct impacts on the staff and the withdrawal of the service; the electricity. 
Nevertheless the nuclear regulatory ratchet, tightened by fierce campaigning
based on information now known to be false, remains just as tight as it has ever been. Leading to an industry
bogged down by regulators and its own failure to push-back and unroll the barriers.
