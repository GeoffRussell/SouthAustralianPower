### Understanding the graph

This graph was produced using the [OpenNEM website](https://opennem.org.au/energy/sa1/?range=7d&interval=5m&view=discrete-time) on the 29th of November 2023. Did I select that date because of some special attributes in
the data? I did notice the small choke point on the evening of the 24th of November, but hadn't quantified
it. I'd had the idea for this project for some time and just happened to make a start on that evening and so used
that week's data. 

If you visit the OpenNEM site now, you'll see a different image, because the make up of the 
electricity supply is heavily dependent on the weather. 

The OpenNem website graph is interactive, allowing you to explore features of the data in considerable detail. But the features software designers choose to measure and highlight never cover everything. 

Look at the vertical axis, you can see 1,500 at the top left. That's 1,500 million watts, usually called mega-watts and abbreviated MW. As I mentioned, this is less than half of peak demand during a heat wave.

The colours represent the different sources of electricity as explained in the legend below the graph; green is wind power. 

### Explainer: Power and energy

Skip this if you understand the difference between power and energy. 

It's not really that complicated. Your electric jug
will have a power rating on it somewhere which will give, obviously,
it's power. Mine is 2,000 watts; which is pretty common. When I was 
growing up, jugs were smaller and typically were about 1,000 watts. Boil
an amount of water in 1,000 and 2,000 watt jugs and the
second will boil it twice as fast.

That's what more power does. Double the power used and the work takes half as long.

But both jugs will use exactly the
same amount of energy to do boil the same amount of water from a starting temperature. 
Run a 2,000 watt jug for 1 hour
and it will use 2,000 watt-hours of electricity. The term watt-hour
is a unit of energy. What could be simpler? Run a power source for
a given length of time and the energy used is just the power
multiplied by the time. Writing it with a hyphen between them makes it
ever so obvious what is happening.  100 kilowatt-hours of electricity
is the quantity of energy used by running:

1. One hundred 1,000 watt jugs for an hour or
1. one huge 100,000 watt urn for an hour or
1. one 1,000 watt jug for 100 hours.

I'm assuming, of course, that most people get that
"kilo" means a thousand; as in kilometre, 1,000 metres. 

1. A *megawatt* (MW) is a thousand kilowatts, meaning a million watts, 
1. A *gigawatt* (GW) is a thousand megawatts, a billion; 1,000,000,000.
1. A *terawatt* (TW) is a thousand gigawatts, a trillion; 1 with 12 zeros after it.

### Shortfall

Australian grids operate in 5 minute planning intervals. Every 5 minutes decisions are made about which 
generators or collectors will provide electricity for the next 5 minute slot. Suppliers bid to be selected. 

Wind and solar farms don't need to bid a high enough amount to make money. They will receive *renewable 
energy credits* for every MWh they supply, they can sell these to people wanting to offset carbon dioxide
emissions. The market price for these is [typically over $40](https://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/Infohub/Markets/Pages/qcmr/march-quarter-2022/Large-scale-generation-certificates-(LGCs).aspx).

For any time slot, I'll assume that if there is wind power available, it will have been selected. Similarly
for solar power. If you look at the image, you'll see that some of the time the colours drop 
below the 0 MW line. These negative values mean power is being exported out across the interconnectors. 

During the previous 12 months, SA was a net electricity importer; we imported 1,605 gigawatt-hours 
and exported about half that, 821 gigawatt hours. 

If you add up the difference between what renewables provided during each 5-minute slot and the demand
during that slot, then you get an *accumulating shortfall*. This assumes, as I said above, that all wind and solar
available gets used. For the week above, the accumulated shortfall at the end of the week is 40 GWh. Multiply that
by 52 and you'd get the total shortfall for the year, if all weeks were the same; which they aren't.  But if this
arbitrary week is representative then we'd expect to need about 2,000 GWh to cover the gap. The total amount 
of Gas fired electricty over the previous 12 months was 3,138 GWh; meaning my arbitrary week was a good week for renewables; normally the shortfall was larger bigger. That 3,138 number comes from an OpenNEM chart. It is
the equivalent of a single 360 MW gas plant running 24x7; a considerable reduction from 2016 when we had 760MW of coal. 

The total output of our wind and solar plants over the past 12 months has been 10,141 GWh (OpenNEM again); that's
about as much as a single full sized nuclear plant.  

### Getting a feel for the dynamics 

The following chart is a simple model of the SA electricity system. It's simple enough 
that anybody can play with it without an engineering degree. But complex enough to help
train our intuition about power, energy, battery capacities and the like. 

It takes the electricity demand in South Australia during a week and the wind+solar output
during that week and displays them. Look at the graph and you can see the holes during the
week where demand isn't met. It's one thing to say that SA gets 72 percent of its electricity
from wind and solar **on average**, without understanding the size of the occasional gaps between
demand and supply.

Here's some exercises you can do with the model. The best way to learn from this model is to demolish
it ... find all its flaws. That's really what it is for! 

1. Don't do anything, just look at the Demand and Wind+Solar curves. They look very different from the chart at the top of the page, but they aren't, they've just been isolated from the interconnector and gas inputs. Notice that the **Overbuild** factor starts at 1 ... so you won't see anything for that at all.

2. Focus on the "Overbuild" slider and set it to something big like 2. Meaning we aim to double the amount of wind and solar while keeping the same proportions. In the real world, the output of such a doubling wouldn't simply
be double the current output, but it wouldn't be wildly different.  You will see a cyan curve appear on the graph. 

### The sliders

The sliders are mostly self explanatory. You change the size of the battery with the "Battery Size in MWh" slider and the overbuild factor with the Overbuild factor slider.  

The two "multiplier" sliders handle the
problem of having a wide range of possible inputs. Consider the "Battery size in MWh" slider. When dealing with
South Australia, we'd be hard put to imagine too many gigawatts of batteries being installed. Having 20,000 MWh (20 GWh) is plenty. But when handling data covering the whole of NEM, we'd like to specify a much bigger battery. But having a slider with 200,000 MWh would be hard to manipulate and the software doesn't allow variable bounds for the slider. 

Having the multiplier sliders allows you to quickly specify larger batteries and baseload specifications for 
the larger states. 

You can see a summary board under the chart. 

Have a look at the night of the 24th of November. It was a *very* still night. Assuming you
have dialled in a doubling of wind+solar, the summary board shows
an accumulated shortfall over the night of 5,463, even with twice the renewables that we have now. Can
we fix that shortfall with storage?
