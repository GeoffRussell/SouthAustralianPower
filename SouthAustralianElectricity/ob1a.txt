### Understanding the graph

This graph was produced using the [OpenNEM website](https://opennem.org.au/energy/sa1/?range=7d&interval=5m&view=discrete-time) on the 29th of November 2023. Did I select that date because of some special attributes in
the data? No, it just happened to be when I started writing.

If you visit the OpenNEM site now, you'll see a different image, because the make up of the 
electricity supply is heavily dependent on the weather. 

The OpenNem website graph is interactive, allowing you to explore features of the data in considerable detail. But the features software designers choose to measure and highlight never cover everything. 

Look at the vertical axis, you can see 1,500 at the top left. That's 1,500 million watts, usually called mega-watts and abbreviated MW. As I mentioned, this is less than half of peak demand during a heat wave.

The colours represent the different sources of electricity as explained in the legend below the graph; green is wind power. 

### Explainer: Power and energy

Skip this if you understand the difference between power and energy. 

It's not really that complicated. Your electric jug
will have a power rating on it somewhere which will give, obviously,
it's power. Mine is 2,000 watts; which is pretty common. When I was 
growing up, jugs were smaller and typically were about 1,000 watts. Boil
an amount of water in 1,000 and 2,000 watt jugs and the
second will boil it twice as fast.

That's what more power does. Double the power used and the work takes half as long.

But both jugs will use exactly the
same amount of energy to do boil the same amount of water from a starting temperature. 
Run a 2,000 watt jug for 1 hour
and it will use 2,000 watt-hours of electricity. The term watt-hour
is a unit of energy. What could be simpler? Run a power source for
a given length of time and the energy used is just the power
multiplied by the time. Writing it with a hyphen between them makes it
ever so obvious what is happening.  100 kilowatt-hours of electricity
is the quantity of energy used by running:

1. One hundred 1,000 watt jugs for an hour or
1. one huge 100,000 watt urn for an hour or
1. one 1,000 watt jug for 100 hours.

I'm assuming, of course, that most people get that
"kilo" means a thousand; as in kilometre, 1,000 metres. 

1. A *megawatt* (MW) is a thousand kilowatts, meaning a million watts, 
1. A *gigawatt* (GW) is a thousand megawatts, a billion; 1,000,000,000.
1. A *terawatt* (TW) is a thousand gigawatts, a trillion; 1 with 12 zeros after it.

### Shortfall

Australian grids operate in 5 minute planning intervals. Every 5 minutes decisions are made about which 
generators or collectors will provide electricity for the next 5 minute slot. Suppliers bid to be selected. 

Wind and solar farms don't need to bid a high enough amount to make money. They will receive *renewable 
energy credits* for every MWh they supply, they can sell these to people wanting to offset carbon dioxide
emissions. The market price for these is [typically over $40](https://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/Infohub/Markets/Pages/qcmr/march-quarter-2022/Large-scale-generation-certificates-(LGCs).aspx).

For any time slot, I'll assume that if there is wind power available, it will have been selected. Similarly
for solar power. If you look at the image, you'll see that some of the time the colours drop 
below the 0 MW line. These negative values mean power is being exported out across the interconnectors. 

During the previous 12 months, SA was a net electricity importer; we imported 1,605 gigawatt-hours 
and exported about half that, 821 gigawatt hours. 

If you add up the difference between what renewables provided during each 5-minute slot and the demand
during that slot, then you get an *accumulating shortfall*. This assumes, as I said above, that all wind and solar
available gets used. For the week above, the accumulated shortfall at the end of the week is 40 GWh. Multiply that
by 52 and you'd get the total shortfall for the year, if all weeks were the same; which they aren't.  But if this
arbitrary week is representative then we'd expect to need about 2,000 GWh to cover the gap. The total amount 
of Gas fired electricty over the previous 12 months was 3,138 GWh; meaning my arbitrary week was a good week for renewables; normally the shortfall was larger bigger. That 3,138 number comes from an OpenNEM chart. It is
the equivalent of a single 360 MW gas plant running 24x7; a considerable reduction from 2016 when we had 760MW of coal. 

The total output of our wind and solar plants over the past 12 months has been 10,141 GWh (OpenNEM again); that's
about as much as a single full sized nuclear plant.
