## A week of SA data

Now here's a chart showing the makeup of a week's worth of electricity in SA during a mild spring
week. 

The horizontal axis is time; covering a week.  You can see the nights are marked
by a dark vertical band. The vertical axis is power. You can see that the wind farms
(green band) produce a considerable portion of the total demand. 

This was a week of mild temperatures; nobody needed heating or cooling. You can see that the
maximum demand was about 1.7 gigawatts (1,700 megawatts). During a heatwave, demand would peak at just over double
this; about 3.5 gigawatts.
