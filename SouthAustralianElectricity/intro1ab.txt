The default selection of regions Germany, Australia and the state of South 
Australia. You can select from 18 countries that account for the bulk of the world's
energy use, population and greenhouse gas emissions. Hover over the chart and you can see 
the size of the individual electricity sources. 

You can also see how well we are travelling in terms of
meeting the International Energy Agency's 2050 targets. The IEA's targets are whole-of-system targets, including
a clear statement that we can't get to net-zero without agriculture (meaning animal agriculture) changing.

South Australia, and Australia as a whole, has lessons for other countries. Critically importand
is the growing problem of *"renewable energy backlogs"*. Why do so many countries have a backlog
of wind and solar farms trying to connect to their grid? Is it just bureaucratic red tape? or is there
an intrinsic engineering problem that makes connecting to the electricity
grid much harder than, for example, plugging another device into a computer network. 

## Complexity at high concentrations of wind+solar 

The following graph is a 2021 estimation from some US [renewable energy experts](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1804705-challenges-achieving-renewable-electricity-system-united-states) on the rising difficulty of implementation as penetration rises for variable renewables, like 
wind and solar. As you can see, South Australia, which produced 72% of its electricity from
wind and solar during the past year, is getting into the area that 
advocates call "challenging" while others call "scary".
