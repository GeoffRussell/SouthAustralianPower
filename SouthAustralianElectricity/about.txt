## Technical details about the OpenNEM data

1. Demand is taken to be the sum of the following fields, basically everything except the "Exports - MW" field 

- Battery (Charging) - MW
- Imports - MW
- Distillate - MW
- Gas (Steam) - MW
- Gas (CCGT) - MW
- Gas (OCGT) - MW
- Gas (Reciprocating) - MW
- Battery (Discharging) - MW
- Wind - MW
- Solar (Utility) - MW
- Solar (Rooftop) - MW

2. Renewable generation is assumed to be the two solar fiels + the wind field + the amount exported. 
ie., the negative of the "Exports - MW". Note that the export field has a negative sign. 
This assumption implies that all of the exported electricity is from the renewable sources. This
may well be false, but it a fairly *renewable-generous* assumption.

3. I assume that any interconnector capacity is only used for export. Currently, most of what is coming
from Victoria will be coal based, but in future, this may not be true. The purpose of the model, as a whole
is to consider the implications of 100% renewables in Australia. In such a situation, the national grid won't
have interconnectors from elsewhere to bail it out when we are short. We can only shift electricity around, not
get any more. As Victoria and NSW get more wind and solar, any excess they have will compete for local
excesses in SA. Will it be windy everywhere or will wind in one geographical region help bail out other
regions? Perhaps I'll work out a way to usefully augment the model with interconnectors as inputs. In one
sense an interconnector is just like a battery with a very large capacity.
