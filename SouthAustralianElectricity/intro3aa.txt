### Offshoring our coal emissions with interconnectors

SA has long been connected to the rest of the eastern
Australian electricity grid, known since the mid 1990s as the NEM, by two connections.
*Heywood*, originally built in 1988 with a capacity of 450MW, was upgraded in 2016
for about $100m [to raise its capacity from 450MW to 650MW](https://www.electranet.com.au/projects/sa-vic-heywood-interconnector-upgrade/). This was the final step needed to totally replace SA coal by Victorian coal. It brings power
up through the south of the state to Adelaide, a sprawling city with a population (1.3m) a little smaller than Munich (1.45m) but 10 times larger in area. Our electricity distribution system has over 70,000 transformers.

The second interconnector, *Murraylink* brings power to the Riverland region north-east of Adelaide.

When the interconnectors are offline, SA is said to be "islanded"; it's a nice 
intuitive term for a grid with no external links. During the 2016
blackout, we were islanded. We were also islanded (without a statewide blackout) in 2020 for 17 days.
