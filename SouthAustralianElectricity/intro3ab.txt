### Project EnergyConnect: preventing wind and solar chaos 

The third interconnection, EnergyConnect, is, as of November 2023,  almost complete. 

When that third interconnector was requested, as a matter of urgency, by AEMO in 2020, here's [what they said](https://www.aemo.com.au/-/media/Files/Electricity/NEM/Planning_and_Forecasting/SA_Advisory/2020/Minimum-Operational-Demand-Thresholds-in-South-Australia-Review):

> *"If EnergyConnect does not proceed, extensive further measures (beyond those outlined in this
> report) will be required to address identified system security risks. Potential further measures
> could include commissioning significant utility-scale storage to provide FFR, retrofit of a large
> number of distributed PV systems to improve disturbance ride-through capabilities, resistor
> banks for managing excess distributed generation, and possibly a moratorium on new dis-
> tributed PV connections."*

Keep in mind that this was request was just four years after the entire state was blacked out, with some
people waiting days for the power to come back on. 

It's worth explaining the jargon, because while the public is regularly exposed to advocates talking up 
renewables, they don't typically plunge into the AEMO engineering documents which expose the chaos behind
the slogans. 

1. "security risks" refer to risks of power failures and blackouts, not risk of espionage or hacking.
2. "significant utility-scale storage" means much bigger batteries to prevent blackouts, I'll explain exactly what this means below.
3. "retrofit ..." the electrical design specifications of inverters, particularly rooftop solar inverters, the 
things connecting them to the grid, have been changed frequently as more and more flaws are discovered. The flaws often
relate to the ability to handle power interruptions. For example, how does your inverter handle a fault when a
tree falls on a power line. Suppose it just disconnects, a common response. This kind of disconnect can cascade through 
the power system as nearby inverters detect a change. There are two problems here; solving the hard design problems and solving them at scale in cheap consumer grade electronics. 
4. "resistor banks" ... more stuff to handle problems.
5. "moratorium" ... everybody knows what this means! 

At the time of the statewide blackout, 28 September 2016, the politics was 
intense. Premier Jay Weatherill and [renewable advocates working
as journalists](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/south-australia-blackout-explained-renewables-not-to-blame) refusing to acknowledge the
event as being caused by the level of renewables in SA. They hid behind a mountain of irrelevant details about wind
turbine settings and storm damage that seemed really important to them because they didn't understand that
the grid had suffered more extreme losses in generation before; without coming down! 

By the time the final official report from AEMO
emerged, in March 2017, the
media had lost interest, the public had moved on, probably to more important matters like football. 
Renewable advocates simply ignored the clear conclusion that *the* crucial
factor which turned a serious storm driven power outage into a
statewide black was the low level of *inertia*; produced because renewables, contributing no inertia,
had displaced the generators which had previously provided it. 

I'll explain "inertia" in more detail below, but the report produces examples of previous
major power outages which didn't cause a statewide shutdown and explains why this lesser outage
was so much worse:


> *"The key differentiator between the 28 September 2016 event and other three events [major power outages] is that there was
> significantly lower inertia in SA in the most recent event, due to a lower number of on-line synchronous
> generators. This resulted in a substantially faster RoCoF [change in frequency] compared to the other events, exceeding the
> ability of the UFLS [load shedding] scheme to arrest the frequency fall before it dropped below 47 Hz."*

There's a bit of jargon in this, but what normally happens on a grid during a major outage (loss of a generator) 
is that the outage causes a drop in AC frequency which is arrested by load shedding; a polite way of saying deliberately 
blacking out enough areas to bring demand for electricity
back into line with the supply from generators still operating. It's conceptually simple, even if the details are mind blowingly
complex.  

You then rapidly bring reserve generators on-line, and restore power to the areas you blacked out.

But with the low inertia caused by renewables displacing the things which normally provided it, 
the drop in frequency was so fast that the mechanisms to respond couldn't keep up. Even huge power outages normally give you (meaning the automated systems) a couple of seconds to respond, but in this state of low inertia, all
they got was 0.6 seconds? The crash was simply too fast.

Clearly, renewables *had* weakened the grid, and the report referred to 
numerous new engineering "challenges" that needed solutions. 

Engineering "challenges" are different from political challenges, they
can't be solved by sound bites or a new and cool "brand ambassador".
