### Project EnergyConnect: preventing wind and solar chaos 

The third interconnection, EnergyConnect, is, as of November 2023,  almost complete. 

When that third interconnector was requested, as a matter of urgency, by AEMO in 2020, here's [what they said](https://www.aemo.com.au/-/media/Files/Electricity/NEM/Planning_and_Forecasting/SA_Advisory/2020/Minimum-Operational-Demand-Thresholds-in-South-Australia-Review):

> *"If EnergyConnect does not proceed, extensive further measures (beyond those outlined in this
> report) will be required to address identified system security risks. Potential further measures
> could include commissioning significant utility-scale storage to provide FFR, retrofit of a large
> number of distributed PV systems to improve disturbance ride-through capabilities, resistor
> banks for managing excess distributed generation, and possibly a moratorium on new dis-
> tributed PV connections."*

Keep in mind that this was request was just four years after the entire state was blacked out, with some
people waiting days for the power to come back on. 

It's worth explaining the jargon, because while the public is regularly exposed to advocates talking up 
renewables, they don't typically plunge into the AEMO engineering documents which expose the chaos behind
the slogans. 

1. "security risks" refer to risks of power failures and blackouts, not risk of espionage or hacking.
2. "significant utility-scale storage" means much bigger batteries to prevent blackouts, I'll explain exactly what this means below.
3. "retrofit ..." the electrical design specifications of inverters,
particularly rooftop solar inverters, the things connecting them to
the grid, have been changed frequently as more and more flaws are
discovered. Mistakes and fixes are normal in any technology. But
some of the flaws in inverters are very different. Ask yourself what
your computer should do when it detects a fluctuation in the
voltage that could wreck the motherboard. Disconnecting is
quite reasonable. But what if an inverter does this when it is
not just receiving power, but supplying it.

   Think about it. You disconnect, this disconnection could be detected as a further
voltage change by other nearby inverters; so they disconnect. It's called a cascade for
obvious reasons. There are two problems here; solving
some subtle design problems and solving them at scale in cheap consumer
grade electronics. Inverter standards were changed in 2020 to try and prevent this problem. But
a [2023 report](https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/initiatives/der/2023/compliance-of-der-with-technical-settings.pdf?la=en) still find high levels of inverters behaving badly. The new standard became mandatory at the end of 2021. Prior to that you could still install inverters intended to comply with the 2015 standards. Not that it mattered much because 30-50% of inverters failed to comply with that standard.

   The report found that the new standard seemed to perform well, meaning to handle faults without
innappropriate disconnection. But more than 55% were installed with incorrect fault handling settings. 
Some manufacturers were able to change settings remotely; some weren't. Other surveys cited
in the report found that only 37% of inverters were installed with the right settings. 

   As of 2019, inverters were also
required to follow other standards concerned not with handling faults, but with handling high 
levels of electricity exported to the grid. Mostly this is an SA problem and SA Power Networks has
had the most experience with these inverter functions. The 2023 report found that some 70% of inverters didn't comply with the standards. 

4. "resistor banks" ... more stuff to handle problems.
5. "moratorium" ... everybody knows what this means! 

### That 2016 blackout in a little more detail

Problems with the grid are deeply political. At the time of the statewide blackout, 
28 September 2016, the politics was 
intense. Premier Jay Weatherill and [renewable advocates working
as journalists](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/south-australia-blackout-explained-renewables-not-to-blame) refusing to acknowledge the
event as being caused by the level of renewables in SA. They hid behind a mountain of irrelevant details about wind
turbine settings and storm damage that seemed really important to them because they didn't understand that
the grid had suffered more extreme losses in generation before; without coming down! 

By the time the final official report from AEMO
emerged, in March 2017, the
media had lost interest, the public had moved on, probably to more important matters like football. 
Renewable advocates simply ignored the clear conclusion that *the* crucial
factor which turned a serious storm driven power outage into a
statewide black was the low level of *inertia*; produced because renewables, contributing no inertia,
had displaced the generators which had previously provided it. 

I'll explain "inertia" in more detail below, but the report produces examples of previous
major power outages which didn't cause a statewide shutdown and explains why this lesser outage
was so much worse:


> *"The key differentiator between the 28 September 2016 event and other three events [major power outages] is that there was
> significantly lower inertia in SA in the most recent event, due to a lower number of on-line synchronous
> generators. This resulted in a substantially faster RoCoF [change in frequency] compared to the other events, exceeding the
> ability of the UFLS [load shedding] scheme to arrest the frequency fall before it dropped below 47 Hz."*

There's a bit of jargon in this, but what normally happens on a grid during a major outage (loss of a generator) 
is that the outage causes a drop in AC frequency which is arrested by load shedding; a polite way of saying deliberately 
blacking out enough areas to bring demand for electricity
back into line with the supply from generators still operating. It's conceptually simple, even if the details are mind blowingly
complex.  

You then rapidly bring reserve generators on-line, and restore power to the areas you blacked out.

But with the low inertia caused by renewables displacing the things which normally provided it, 
the drop in frequency was so fast that the mechanisms to respond couldn't keep up. Even huge power outages normally give you (meaning the automated systems) a couple of seconds to respond, but in this state of low inertia, all
they got was 0.6 seconds? The crash was simply too fast.

Clearly, renewables *had* weakened the grid, and the report referred to 
numerous new engineering "challenges" that needed solutions. 

Engineering "challenges" are different from political challenges, they
can't be solved by sound bites or a new and cool "brand ambassador". 

Which brings us to *inertia* (next Tab).
