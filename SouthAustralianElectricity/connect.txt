## Grid connection bottlenecks and red tape

Many people are aware of a large number of solar and wind farms waiting to connect to grids around
the world. There are usually references to red tape and calls for reform.

But there are good reasons having nothing to do with red tape for the connection bottlenecks.

Back in the old days of high inertia and something else called "system strength" (which is far more
complex), connecting new
power plants was relatively simple. Firstly, it didn't happen often, and secondly,
the complexity of such grids was low and relatively easily modelled with software. 

### We can do this the easy way or the hard way

There are two levels of software modelling for grids. You don't have to understand anything about
them except that one is fast and relatively simple (for an electrical engineer), and the second is
slow and complex (even for the best engineers).   

Basically, wind and solar have undermined the ability to do relatively quick and simple grid modelling of
proposed changes. Consider the following image from an Australian grid connection information clip.





Note that I keep saying "wind and solar" and not "renewables". Why? Burning forests and flooding valleys are
just old-school thermal power plants. The DRAX powerplant in the UK used to run on coal. Now it burns 
wood. The grid doesn't care. It's just a thermal power plant, meaning it produces steam which drives 
a turbine which produces electricity. DRAX burned ??? tonnes of wood pellets imported, mostly, from 
the US in 2021. It's renewable, but it sucks. 

Wind and solar are different. The acronym VRE, "variable renewable energy" captures the difference, 
but acronyms suck also.
