## Grid connection bottlenecks and red tape

Many people are aware of a large number of solar and wind farms waiting to connect to grids around
the world. There are usually references to red tapes and calls for reform, blah blah blah.

The connection bottlenecks have nothing to do with red tape. Not that I can confidently deny the
existence of such tape wrapping each and every grid on the planet. But what I can be sure of
is that there are some very real and very complex impediments to rapid grid connection of any 
new significant wind or solar power collector.  

Back in the old days of high inertia and something else called "system strength" (which we won't discuss), 
connecting new
power plants was relatively simple. Firstly, because it didn't happen often, and secondly because
the complexity of such grids was low and relatively easily modelled with software.

There are two levels of software modelling for grids. You don't have to understand anything about
them except that one is fast and relatively simple (for an electrical engineer), and the second is
slow and complex (even for the best engineers).  

Basically, wind and solar have undermined the ability to do relatively quick and simple grid modelling of
proposed changes. 

Note that I keep saying "wind and solar" and not "renewables". Why? Burning forests and flooding valleys are
just old-school thermal power plants. The DRAX powerplant in the UK used to run on coal. Now it burns 
wood. The grid doesn't care. It's just a thermal power plant, meaning it produces steam which drives 
a turbine which produces electricity. DRAX burned ??? tonnes of wood pellets imported, mostly, from 
the US in 2021. It's renewable, but it sucks. 

Wind and solar are different. The acronym VRE, "variable renewable energy" captures the difference, 
but acronyms suck also.
