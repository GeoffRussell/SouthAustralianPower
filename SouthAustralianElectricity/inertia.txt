### Inertia

Inertia is one of a cluster of grid attributes that wind and solar screw up. I won't
deal with the others. One is enough.

Inertia in an electrical system has plenty of good analogies from daily
life. Stopping an empty shopping trolley is easy. Fill it with 40 kilos
of beer and it becomes really hard to wrangle. 

Our *alternating current* electricity supply swings backwards and forwards
between plus and minus 240 volts. The swings happen 50 times a second. 
Coal, gas, nuclear and hydro electricity generators are massive spinning lumps of metal. These are your
full shopping trolley and they are a bugger to slow down.

It's the *spinning* of the metal masses that creates the alternating
current in our powersupply. Each revolution of the spinning lump of
metal is one cycle of the voltage. The spinning and the electricity
frequency are one and the same. 50 times a second means the generator
rotors (the lumps) are spinning at 3,000 revolutions per minute. If you
lose one such generator, then the other generators will experience a
drag and slow down slightly in response to the extra power they need to
supply. The inertia of the spinning masses give the grid operator enough
time to connect an reserve generator to replace the failed one. Assuming that
the reserve generator is up and running, but just not connected. These
spare generators are called, obviously enough ... "spinning reserves".

A battery can do something similar. It can quickly connect to make up
for the shortfall when a generator fails. In a traditional grid, inertia
rides over small changes and buys time to handle bigger ones. A battery can
similarly buy time, but for what purpose? In a predominantly wind and
solar system, there may be *nothing to turn on*. You can't just start up
a solar farm when a wind farm fails in the middle of the night. You
could perhaps have a wind turbine operating like spinning reserve; if
it was windy. But on a still night? What then? In such situations the
battery has to be more than something to buy time, it has to actually
supply energy for an extended period; until the fault is fixed.

As well as dealing with loss of generation, the grid has to deal with
changes in demand.  Starting an aluminium smelter requiring 500 megawatts
of power will require the grid operator to rapidly add 500 megawatts of
generation. The inertia of the spinning lumps of metal slows the rate at
which the frequency drops just long enough to bring another generator
on line at best, or, at worst, kick some other users of the system (ie.,
deliberately blackout a suburb or two).

Renewables are, ever so slowly, being reengineered to provide alternative
mechanisms to achieve the same goal; usually via batteries. But the
new and advanced engineering to do this was far from clear in 2016;
let alone built into wind turbines and solar farms. It's come a long
way since 2016 and we'll get to it in due course. Why has progress on making renewables
do these things been so slow? Because they are incredibly complex to fix do well; there is
no lack of will. 

And how did AEMO eventually fix the problem of low inertia on the SA grid and the risks it posed? 

A few years after the blackout, and with very little fanfare, [four synchronous condensers](https://www.electranet.com.au/what-we-do/projects/power-system-strength/) were installed; at a cost of $166 
million. These
are large spinning lumps of metal that provide the same kind of inertia that the generators
displaced by wind farms and solar panels had
provided for free. They are connected to the grid and provide inertia, they just don't generate 
any actual power (or carbon dioxide emissions).  

Following the blackout, Elon Musk famously installed the then "biggest battery in the world", which could provide 100MW for a bit over an hour. Was it big enough to prevent a repeat of the blackout with a similar sequence of events? Nobody bothered to ask. You have to understand that Adelaide is a small city and having the world's biggest battery was an incredible event. Almost worth having the blackout! 

But the following year, 2017, Australia's Council of Learned Academies put out
a [report](https://acola.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hs1_role-energy-storage_acola_summary-paper.pdf) on storage technologies. They asked that question and
specifically estimated that it would have taken 600MW of batteries to have prevented the
2016 SA blackout; i.e., 6 times the size of that biggest-battery-in-the-world! 

Batteries have grown in size since 2016, but 600MW is still a big
battery, even if it can only run for an hour.  The [Victorian Big
Battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Big_Battery) is 300MW
and cost $160m.  Synchronous condensers, in comparison, are relatively
cheap and run for decades, batteries charge you every time you
use them, and their operators know just how vulnerable you are when you
need them. The term *price gouging* leaps to mind.

### The third interconnector: EnergyConnect

The stationary condensers provide inertia, but, like batteries, they won't get you over a long
loss of generation. Enter the new EnergyConnect interconnector.

Once this new interconnector is complete, SA will have access to about 1670MW of 
Victorian coal power to allow it to both keep the lights on and 
continue pretending that it is a renewable electricity success story. All SA has actually done, is
the relatively easy bit.
