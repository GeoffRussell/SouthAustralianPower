This website (driven by [*shiny*](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/) software) will analyse the renewable energy
rollout in South Australia (SA). In the SA context, this means a wind and solar rollout. Why? Because
SA is one of the driest places on the planet, so it has virtually no rivers suitable for 
hydro-electricity, nor and forests it can burn. Consequently it is a natural experiment in variable renewable
resources and has more wind and solar power per person than pretty much anywhere on the planet. 

It's a real world experiment in non-trivial penetration of wind and solar power 
into an non-trivial grid. 

The SA grid is fairly small, serving about 1.7 million people, but big enough
to serve as a canary in a coal mine (bad pun intended). 

### SA offshoring coal emissions 

SA closed it's last coal plant in 2016.

Retired Coal plants        Capacity      Closed
-----------------------   ---------    --------
Playford B                    240MW        2012
Northern                      520MW    May 2016

SA has long been connected to the rest of the eastern
Australian electricity grid, known as the NEM by two connections.
Heywood, originally built in 1988 with a capacity of 450MW, was upgraded in 2016
for about $100m [to raise its capacity from 450MW to 650MW](https://www.electranet.com.au/projects/sa-vic-heywood-interconnector-upgrade/). This was the final step to totally replace SA coal by Victorian coal. Playford A was 
a 90MW coal plant closed earlier in 1985, a few years before Heywood was complete. 

Currently there are two interconnectors, Heywood bringing power up to Adelaide 
from the south and Murraylink bringing power to the Riverland region north-east of Adelaide.

Interconnector       Capacity       Status    Type
---------------    ----------  ----------- -------
Heywood               650MW      Operating    AC
Murraylink            220MW      Operating    DC
Energy Connect        800MW     InProgress    AC

The third interconnection is, as of November 2023,  almost complete. 

When it was requested as a matter of urgency by AEMO in 2020, here's [what they said](https://www.aemo.com.au/-/media/Files/Electricity/NEM/Planning_and_Forecasting/SA_Advisory/2020/Minimum-Operational-Demand-Thresholds-in-South-Australia-Review):

> *"If EnergyConnect does not proceed, extensive further measures (beyond those outlined in this
> report) will be required to address identified system security risks. Potential further measures
> could include commissioning significant utility-scale storage to provide FFR, retrofit of a large
> number of distributed PV systems to improve disturbance ride-through capabilities, resistor
> banks for managing excess distributed generation, and possibly a moratorium on new dis-
> tributed PV connections."*

Keep in mind that this was request was just four years after the entire state was blacked out, with some
people waiting days for the power to come back on. 

At the time, September 2016, the politics was intense with Premier Jay Weatherill and [renewable advocates working
as journalists](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/south-australia-blackout-explained-renewables-not-to-blame) refusing to acknowledge the
event as being caused by the level of renewables in SA. By the time the final official report emerged, in March, the
heat had gone out of the issue and renewable advocates ignored what turned a storm driven power outage into a
statewide black. Power systems are designed to suffer major outages without total failure. What was different this time:

> *"The key differentiator between the 28 September 2016 event and other three events is that there was
> significantly lower inertia in SA in the most recent event, due to a lower number of on-line synchronous
> generators. This resulted in a substantially faster RoCoF compared to the other events, exceeding the
> ability of the UFLS scheme to arrest the frequency fall before it dropped below 47 Hz."*

What is "lower inertia"? We'll get to that, but what caused it? The high level of renewables and the shutdown of the plants that normally provided it. Meaning, the final AEMO report was a slam dunk against renewables. 


## Inertia

Coal, gas, nuclear and hydro electricity generators are massive spinning lumps of metal. They physically act
to slow frequency changes in the electricity supply when one of their number fails. Renewables may eventually provide
a different mechanisms to achieve the same goal; usually via batteries. But the new and advanced engineering to do
this was far from clear in 2016; let alone built into wind turbines and solar farms.

And how did AEMO eventually fix the problem of low inertia on the SA grid and the risks it posed? 

With [four synchronous condensers](https://www.electranet.com.au/what-we-do/projects/power-system-strength/). These
are large spinning lumps of metal that provide the same kind of inertia that traditional generators provide for free, but without generating any actual power (or carbon dioxide emissions).  

Couldn't batteries provide the same service? Following the blackout, Elon Musk famously installed the then "biggest battery in the world". Didn't it work? Yes. Was it big enough to prevent a repeat of the blackout with a similar sequence of events? Australia's Council of Learned Academies put out
a [report in 2017](https://acola.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hs1_role-energy-storage_acola_summary-paper.pdf) on battery storage. They specifically estimated that it would have taken 600MW of batteries to have prevented the
2016 SA blackout. That's double the 300MW of the $160m [Victorian Big Battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Big_Battery).  Synchronous condensers, in comparison, are cheap ($166m) and run for decades, 
batteries are just continuous price gaugers; charging whatever the market will bare when the grid is in a 
weak state.

## EnergyConnect

Once the EnergyConnect interconnector is complete, SA will have access to about 1670MW of 
Victorian coal power to allow it to both keep the lights on and 
continue pretending that it is a renewable electricity success story .

## Intermittent renewable energy in South Australia 

The data in this page is either from the latest [Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review), meaning it is 2022 data from the 2023 report) or [OpenNem](https://opennem.org.au/energy/nem/?range=7d&interval=30m&view=discrete-time) a website which displays data from
Australian electricity markets. 


A generous [feed in tariff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed-in_tariffs_in_Australia#South_Australia) was introduced into South Australia in 2006 with the then Premier Mike Rann aiming for the state to be carbon neutral by 2020. And now, in 2023, after 17 years of solar and wind installations, SA is a world leader in wind and solar electricity generation. Australian's simply love to use the phrase "punching above our weight", and we are. Not that we make the panels or the wind turbines or even the batteries. We are pretty much, like the rest of the planet, punching in the anorexic weight class of the energy generation championships.
