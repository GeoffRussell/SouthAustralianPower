This [*shiny*](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/) website will analyse the renewable energy
rollout in South Australia (SA); which means wind and solar. Why? Because
SA has more wind and solar power per person than pretty much anywhere on the planet. It's a real world
experiment in non-trivial penetration of wind and solar power into an non-trivial grid. SA has no hydro-electricity
and no bioenergy; other than burning garbage at our main waste dump in Adelaide. This is roughly 1/10th of one percent
of our electricity power generation capacity.

The SA grid is fairly small, serving about 1.7 million people, but big enough
to serve as a canary in a coal mine (bad pun intended). It is connected to the rest of the eastern
Australian electricity grid, known as the NEM by two connections with a third under construction. 

Why does such a small state suddenly need another interconnector, for AU$2.1 billion?  Please read on.

## Intermittent renewable energy in South Australia 

A generous [feed in tariff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed-in_tariffs_in_Australia#South_Australia) was introduced into South Australia in 2006 with the then Premier Mike Rann aiming for the state to be carbon neutral by 2020. And now, in 2023, after 17 years of solar and wind installations, SA is a world leader in wind and solar electricity generation. Australian's simply love to use the phrase "punching above our weight", and we are. Not that we make the panels or the wind turbines or even the batteries. We are pretty much, like the rest of the planet, punching in the anorexic weight class of the
energy generation championships.
