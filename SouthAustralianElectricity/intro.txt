This [*shiny*](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/) website will analyse a week's worth of data from South Australia (SA). Why? Because
SA has more wind and solar power per person than pretty much anywhere on the planet. It's a real world
experiment in non-trivial penetration of wind and solar power into an non-trivial grid. 

The SA grid is fairly small, serving about 1.7 million people, but big enough
to serve as a canary in a coal mine (bad pun intended). It is connected to the rest of the eastern
Australian electricity grid, known as the NEM by two connections with a third under construction. Why does
a small state suddenly need another interconnector, for AU$2.1 billion?  Please read on.

## Intermittent renewable energy in South Australia 

A generous [feed in tariff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed-in_tariffs_in_Australia#South_Australia) was introduced into South Australia in 2006 with the then Premier Mike Rann aiming for the state to be carbon neutral by 2020. And now, in 2023, after 17 years of solar and wind installations, SA is a world leader in demonstrating the failure of intermittent renewable energy to match the speed and effectiveness of nuclear rollouts in the 70s, 80s and 90s.
