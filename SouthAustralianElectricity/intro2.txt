SA has long been connected to the rest of the eastern
Australian electricity grid, known as the NEM by two connections.
*Heywood*, originally built in 1988 with a capacity of 450MW, was upgraded in 2016
for about $100m [to raise its capacity from 450MW to 650MW](https://www.electranet.com.au/projects/sa-vic-heywood-interconnector-upgrade/). This was the final step to totally replace SA coal by Victorian coal. *Playford A* was 
a 90MW coal plant closed earlier in 1985, a few years before *Heywood* was complete. 

Currently there are two interconnectors, *Heywood* bringing power up to Adelaide 
from the south and *Murraylink* bringing power to the Riverland region north-east of Adelaide.
