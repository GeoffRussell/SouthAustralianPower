I live in SA, and while our 1.8 million people is a much smaller population than Germany's, our electricity grid is
non-trivial and big enough to serve as a model, or perhaps a warning, for others aspiring to a high penetration of
intermittent renewables.

*Renewables*, in the SA context, is restricted to wind turbines and solar panels. This Australian state, over double the size of Germany, is one of the driest places on the planet. So, unlike Germany, we have virtually no forests we
can burn or rivers we can dam. 

Look at the chart reference to the "diurnal mismatch problem". This is a pretentious name for the problem of
the sun being elsewhere at night. In SA we have another problem, not mentioned on the chart and best explained by
an image from 2019. This is the season of the "black summer bushfires" in Australia. 

When we have heat waves in SA, the days are often very very still. Alternatively, we can get hot 
north winds. These winds blowing from the hot center of Australia have always heralded fires. 
In the four days to 20th of December 2019, we had four 
days over 42 degrees C in succession; with the 4th day bringing those hot north
winds and horrific fires in the Hills around Adelaide and on Kangaroo Island. 

Here's a graph showing the electrical demand and the wind power
output during that horror week.
