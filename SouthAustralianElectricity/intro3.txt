The third interconnection is, as of November 2023,  almost complete. 

When it was requested, as a matter of urgency, by AEMO in 2020, here's [what they said](https://www.aemo.com.au/-/media/Files/Electricity/NEM/Planning_and_Forecasting/SA_Advisory/2020/Minimum-Operational-Demand-Thresholds-in-South-Australia-Review):

> *"If EnergyConnect does not proceed, extensive further measures (beyond those outlined in this
> report) will be required to address identified system security risks. Potential further measures
> could include commissioning significant utility-scale storage to provide FFR, retrofit of a large
> number of distributed PV systems to improve disturbance ride-through capabilities, resistor
> banks for managing excess distributed generation, and possibly a moratorium on new dis-
> tributed PV connections."*

Keep in mind that this was request was just four years after the entire state was blacked out, with some
people waiting days for the power to come back on. 

I won't explain the jargon except to say that "security risks" refer to risks of power failures
and blackouts, not risk of espionage or hacking.

At the time of the big one, 28 September 2016, the politics was 
intense. Premier Jay Weatherill and [renewable advocates working
as journalists](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/south-australia-blackout-explained-renewables-not-to-blame) refusing to acknowledge the
event as being caused by the level of renewables in SA. They piled up a mountain of irrelevant details about wind
turbine settings and towers buckling that seemed really important to them because they never understood that
equipment failures are frequent and normal on a grid; but they don't bring it down!


By the time the final official report from AEMO
emerged, in March 2017, the
heat had gone out of the issue, the public had moved on, probably to more important matters like football, 
and renewable advocates simply ignored the clear conclusion that the crucial
factor which turned a serious storm driven power outage into a
statewide black was the low level of *inertia*; produced because renewables had replaced the kinds of
generators which provide inertia. I'll explain "inertia" in more detail below, but the report is clear:


> *"The key differentiator between the 28 September 2016 event and other three events [major power outages] is that there was
> significantly lower inertia in SA in the most recent event, due to a lower number of on-line synchronous
> generators. This resulted in a substantially faster RoCoF [change in frequency] compared to the other events, exceeding the
> ability of the UFLS [load shedding] scheme to arrest the frequency fall before it dropped below 47 Hz."*

There's a bit of jargon but what normally happens on a grid is that failures of generators result in the frequency
dropping and load shedding; a polite way of saying deliberately blacking out enough areas that supply and demand
are balanced. As you rapidly bring reserve generators on-line, the power is restored to the areas you blacked out.
But with the low inertia, the crash was so fast that the mechanisms to respond couldn't keep up. Even huge power outages normally give you (meaning the automated systems) a couple of seconds to respond, but 0.6 seconds? The crash was
simply too fast.

What is "lower inertia"? We'll explain the concept shortly, but it is clear that 
renewables had screwed up the grid, with the report referring to numerous engineering "challenges" that
needed solutions. Engineering "challenges" are different from political challenges, they
can't be solved by sound bites or a fresh new font or colour scheme. 

## Inertia

Our *alternating current* electricity supply swings backwards and forwards
between plus and minus 240 volts. The swings happen 50 times a second. 
Coal, gas, nuclear and hydro electricity generators are massive spinning lumps of metal. If you understand how hard it is to slow a goods train, then you'll get that slowing these spinning masses is also hard. It's their spinning that
creates the alternating current in our powersupply. The spinning and the electricity frequency are one and the same. 
The spinning lumps of metal act as
drag to slow frequency changes in the electricity 
supply in response to the loss of a generator. It's a grid stabilising service the generators 
used to provide for free and nobody thought
twice about it as a service until it was gone.  

Start up an aluminium smelter requiring 500 megawatts of power and, without adding extra power to the grid, the frequency will fall.  The inertia of the spinning lumps of metal slows that
frequency drop just long enough to or bring another generator on line at best, or, at worst, 
kick some other users of the system (ie., deliberately blackout a suburb or two).

Renewables are gradually being reengineered to provide
alternative mechanisms to achieve the same goal; usually via batteries. But the new and advanced engineering to do
this was far from clear in 2016; let alone built into wind turbines and solar farms. It didn't matter how many
engineers had been warning about the problems; nobody was listening, what the f*ck do they know!

And how did AEMO eventually fix the problem of low inertia on the SA grid and the risks it posed? 

A few years after the event, and with very little fanfare, [four synchronous condensers](https://www.electranet.com.au/what-we-do/projects/power-system-strength/) were installed. These
are large spinning lumps of metal that provide the same kind of inertia that the generators
displaced by wind farms and solar panels had
provided for free. They spin and provide inertia, they just don't generate any actual power (or carbon dioxide emissions).  

Couldn't batteries provide the same service? Following the blackout, Elon Musk famously installed the then "biggest battery in the world", which could provide 100MW for a bit over an hour. 
Was it big enough to prevent a repeat of the blackout with a similar sequence of events? Australia's Council of Learned Academies put out
a [report in 2017](https://acola.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hs1_role-energy-storage_acola_summary-paper.pdf) on battery storage. They specifically estimated that it would have taken 600MW of batteries to have prevented the
2016 SA blackout; i.e., 6 times the size of that biggest-battery-in-the-world. 

Batteries have grown in size since 2016, but 600MW is still a big battery, even if it can only run for an hour. 
The [Victorian Big Battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Big_Battery) is 300MW and cost $160m.  
Synchronous condensers, in comparison, are cheap ($166m) and run for decades, 
batteries are just continuous price gaugers; charging whatever the market will bare when the grid is in a 
weak state. 

## EnergyConnect

Once the new EnergyConnect interconnector is complete, SA will have access to about 1670MW of 
Victorian coal power to allow it to both keep the lights on and 
continue pretending that it is a renewable electricity success story. All SA has actually done, is
the relatively easy bit. 

## US renewable energy experts 

[*In a June 2021 scientific paper*](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1804705-challenges-achieving-renewable-electricity-system-united-states), lead author Paul Denholm and sixteen other researchers from three US renewable energy institutes outlined
the problems confronting advocates for high penetration of wind and solar power. Keep in mind that other countries also
burn forests and dam rivers to provide electricity on still nights. In SA we have precious little in the way of
forest or hydro resources. The experts summarised the state of high penetration renewable grids in a diagram:
