The third interconnection is, as of November 2023,  almost complete. 

### Two ways to alleviate the chaos 

When that third interconnector was requested, as a matter of urgency, by AEMO in 2020, here's [what they said](https://www.aemo.com.au/-/media/Files/Electricity/NEM/Planning_and_Forecasting/SA_Advisory/2020/Minimum-Operational-Demand-Thresholds-in-South-Australia-Review):

> *"If EnergyConnect does not proceed, extensive further measures (beyond those outlined in this
> report) will be required to address identified system security risks. Potential further measures
> could include commissioning significant utility-scale storage to provide FFR, retrofit of a large
> number of distributed PV systems to improve disturbance ride-through capabilities, resistor
> banks for managing excess distributed generation, and possibly a moratorium on new dis-
> tributed PV connections."*

Keep in mind that this was request was just four years after the entire state was blacked out, with some
people waiting days for the power to come back on. 

It's worth explaining the jargon, because while the public is regularly exposed to advocates talking up 
renewables, they don't typically plunge into the AEMO engineering documents which expose the chaos behind
the slogans. 

1. "security risks" refer to risks of power failures and blackouts, not risk of espionage or hacking.
2. "significant utility-scale storage" means much bigger batteries to prevent blackouts, I'll explain exactly what this means below.
3. "retrofit ..." the electrical design specifications of inverters, particularly rooftop solar inverters, the 
things connecting them to the grid, have been changed frequently as more and more flaws are discovered. The flaws often
relate to the ability to handle power interruptions. For example, how does your inverter handle a fault when a
tree falls on a power line. Suppose it just disconnects, a common response. This kind of disconnect can cascade through 
the power system as nearby inverters detect a change. There are two problems here; solving the hard design problems and solving them at scale in cheap consumer grade electronics. 
4. "resistor banks" ... more stuff to handle problems.
5. "moratorium" ... everybody knows what this means! 

At the time of the statewide blackout, 28 September 2016, the politics was 
intense. Premier Jay Weatherill and [renewable advocates working
as journalists](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/south-australia-blackout-explained-renewables-not-to-blame) refusing to acknowledge the
event as being caused by the level of renewables in SA. They hid behind a mountain of irrelevant details about wind
turbine settings and storm damage that seemed really important to them because they didn't understand that
the grid had suffered more extreme losses in generation before; without coming down! 

By the time the final official report from AEMO
emerged, in March 2017, the
media had lost interest, the public had moved on, probably to more important matters like football, 
and renewable advocates simply ignored the clear conclusion that the crucial
factor which turned a serious storm driven power outage into a
statewide black was the low level of *inertia*; produced because renewables, contributing no inertia,
had displaced the generators which had previously provided it. 

I'll explain "inertia" in more detail below, but the report produces examples of previous
major power outages which didn't cause a statewide shutdown and explains why this lesser outage
was so much worse:


> *"The key differentiator between the 28 September 2016 event and other three events [major power outages] is that there was
> significantly lower inertia in SA in the most recent event, due to a lower number of on-line synchronous
> generators. This resulted in a substantially faster RoCoF [change in frequency] compared to the other events, exceeding the
> ability of the UFLS [load shedding] scheme to arrest the frequency fall before it dropped below 47 Hz."*

There's a bit of jargon in this, but what normally happens on a grid during a major outage (loss of a generator) 
is that the outage causes a drop in AC frequency which is arrested by load shedding; a polite way of saying deliberately 
blacking out enough areas to bring demand for electricity
back into line with the supply from generators still operating. It's conceptually simple, even if the details are mind blowingly
complex.  

You then rapidly bring reserve generators on-line, and restore power to the areas you blacked out.

But with the low inertia caused by renewables displacing the things which normally provided it, 
the drop in frequency was so fast that the mechanisms to respond couldn't keep up. Even huge power outages normally give you (meaning the automated systems) a couple of seconds to respond, but in this state of low inertia, all
they got was 0.6 seconds? The crash was simply too fast.

What is "lower inertia"? We'll explain the concept shortly, but it is clear that 
renewables had screwed up the grid, and the report referred to numerous new engineering "challenges" that
needed solutions. 

Engineering "challenges" are different from political challenges, they
can't be solved by sound bites or a new and cool "brand ambassador". 

### Inertia

Inertia in an electrical system has plenty of good analogies from daily life. Stopping an empty shopping trolley
is easy. Fill it with 40 kilos of beer and it becomes really hard to wrangle.

Our *alternating current* electricity supply swings backwards and forwards
between plus and minus 240 volts. The swings happen 50 times a second. 
Coal, gas, nuclear and hydro electricity generators are massive spinning lumps of metal. These are your
full shopping trolley and they are a bugger to slow down.

It's the *spinning* of the metal masses that
creates the alternating current in our powersupply. Each revolution of the spinning lump of metal is one cycle
of the voltage. The spinning and the electricity frequency are one and the same. 50 times a second means the generator
rotors (the lumps) are spinning at 3,000 revolutions per minute. If you lose one such generator, then the other
generators will slow down slightly in response to the extra power they need to supply. The inertia of the spinning
masses give the grid operator enough to 
connect an reserve generator to replace the failed one. Assuming that the reserve generator is
up and running, but just not connected. These are called obviously enough ... "spinning reserves". 

A battery can do something similar. It can quickly connect to make up
for the shortfall when a generator fails. In a traditional grid, inertia rides over small changes and buys time to
handle big ones. A battery can similarly buy time, but for what purpose? In a predominantly wind and solar 
system, there may be nothing to turn on. You can't just start up a solar farm when a wind farm goes down in the 
middle of the night. You could perhaps have a wind turbine operating like spinning reserve; if it was windy. But
on a still night? What then? In that situations the battery has to be more than something to buy time, it has 
to actually supply energy for an extended period; until the fault is fixed. 

As well as dealing with loss of generation, the grid has to deal with changes in demand.
Starting an aluminium smelter requiring 500 megawatts of power will require the grid operator to rapidly add
500 megawatts of generation. The inertia of the spinning lumps of metal slows the rate at which the frequency
drops just long enough to or bring another generator on line at best, or, at worst, 
kick some other users of the system (ie., deliberately blackout a suburb or two).

Renewables are gradually being reengineered to provide
alternative mechanisms to achieve the same goal; usually via batteries. But the new and advanced engineering to do
this was far from clear in 2016; let alone built into wind turbines and solar farms. It's come a long way since 2016 and we'll get to it in due course. 

And how did AEMO eventually fix the problem of low inertia on the SA grid and the risks it posed? 

A few years after the blackout, and with very little fanfare, [four synchronous condensers](https://www.electranet.com.au/what-we-do/projects/power-system-strength/) were installed; at a cost of $166m. These
are large spinning lumps of metal that provide the same kind of inertia that the generators
displaced by wind farms and solar panels had
provided for free. They are connected to the grid and provide inertia, they just don't generate 
any actual power (or carbon dioxide emissions).  

Following the blackout, Elon Musk famously installed the then "biggest battery in the world", which could provide 100MW for a bit over an hour. Was it big enough to prevent a repeat of the blackout with a similar sequence of events? You have to understand that Adelaide is a small city and having the world's biggest battery was an incredible event. Almost worth
having the blackout! 

The following year, 2017, Australia's Council of Learned Academies put out
a [report](https://acola.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hs1_role-energy-storage_acola_summary-paper.pdf) on storage technologies. They specifically estimated that it would have taken 600MW of batteries to have prevented the
2016 SA blackout; i.e., 6 times the size of that biggest-battery-in-the-world! 

Batteries have grown in size since 2016, but 600MW is still a big battery, even if it can only run for an hour. 
The [Victorian Big Battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Big_Battery) is 300MW and cost $160m.  
Synchronous condensers, in comparison, are relatively cheap ($166m) and run for decades, 
batteries charge you every time you use them, and their operators know just how vulnerable you are when you
need them. The term *price gouging* leaps to mind.   

### The third interconnector: EnergyConnect

The stationary condensers provide inertia, but, like batteries they won't get you over a long
loss of generation. Enter the new EnergyConnect interconnector.

Once this new interconnector is complete, SA will have access to about 1670MW of 
Victorian coal power to allow it to both keep the lights on and 
continue pretending that it is a renewable electricity success story. All SA has actually done, is
the relatively easy bit.
