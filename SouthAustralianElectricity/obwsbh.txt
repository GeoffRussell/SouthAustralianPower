## International comparisons

The following chart shows low-carbon electricity for 20 countries, chosen on the basis of being the
top 20 countries by wind power per person. 
The black diamonds are the total per person annual electricty generation in
each country and in SA. The country data is 2022 data so you can see that Germany still has some nuclear power. 

The data for SA isn't from SRWE is the 12 months from November 2022 to November 2023, courtesy of OpenNem. During this
period, SA got 71% of its electricity from wind and solar power. 

How has this been achieved without biomass, hydro or nuclear?

Remember that $2.1 billion interconnector? It supplies electricity to the state from Victoria; mostly generated
from fossil fuel power stations in that state.
