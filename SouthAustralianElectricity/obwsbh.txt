## International comparisons

The following chart shows low-carbon electricity for 20 countries, chosen on the basis of being the
top 20 countries by wind power per person. 

The red shaded area is the aspirational target of Australia's AEMO ISP by 2050 (the Integrated System Plan of our Energy
Market Operator). This target is that **the grid** should be supplying about double what it supplies today;
meaning **in addition** to whatever rooftop and domestic batteries supply. The international IEA has a similar target.

Note that the national data in the chart is from 2022, which is why Germany still has some nuclear power. 

The data for SA isn't from SRWE is the 12 months from November 2022 to November 2023, courtesy of OpenNem. During this
period, SA got 71% of its electricity from wind and solar power. 

How has this been achieved without the biomass, hydro or nuclear which is used by other countries to
cover the gaps in intermittent energy supply. 

Remember that $2.1 billion interconnector? It will allow even more electricity to flow to SA from Victoria; 
mostly generated from fossil fuel power stations in that state. Currently, the flow from Victoria is limited 
to 650MW from the Heywood Interconnector and 220MW from Murraylink. In the past 12 months, SA has received about 1600 GWh of electricity via these links and sent about half that in the reverse direction to Victoria. Even though SA has 500MW of battery power capacity, the two significant batteries (Torrens Island BESS and Hornsdale Power Reserve)
can only run at full power for 1 and 2 hours respectively. So those batteries have supplied just 88 GWh of electricity.
