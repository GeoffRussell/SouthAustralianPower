Are the AEMO and IEA aspirational targets to double electricity really necessary? 

How much electricity you need is determined by the economy you want. If you can afford to buy energy intensive 
manufactured goods like aluminium, batteries, phones, computers, ChatGPT and so on, then you may not need to double your electricity. Australia is ranked 82 on the [economic complexity index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Complexity_Index), down with many developing countries. Our relatively small range of resource and commodity exports have made us wealthy more by good luck than by skill and ingenuity.

Compare South Australia, or Australia as a whole, with the UAE. As a country we have more than double the population. We used to have 6 aluminium smelters, but 2 have closed. Tomago, for example, has called for a plan to [operate with
renewable](https://reneweconomy.com.au/tomago-aluminium-smelter-seeks-partners-in-shift-to-100-pct-renewables/) power. It
needs a constant 850MW power supply. Australia's largest **proposed** battery is expected to cost
$AU1.9 billion and can supply 1.2GW of power for 2 hours. Buy 3 of these and you could get the smelter through a
single 8 hour shift. The UAE has 4 x 1.4GW nuclear reactors, built for about $US5 billion each and they can 
drive the UAE's smelters continuously. Consequently, the UAE can supply low carbon aluminium to European car
makers.
