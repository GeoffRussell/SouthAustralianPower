## Intermittent renewable energy in South Australia 

A generous [feed in tariff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed-in_tariffs_in_Australia#South_Australia) was introduced into South Australia in 2006 with the then Premier Mike Rann aiming for the state to be carbon neutral by 2020. And now, in 2023, after 17 years of solar and wind installations, SA is a world leader in wind and solar electricity generation. Australian's simply love to use the phrase "punching above our weight", and we are. Not that we make the panels or the wind turbines or even the batteries. We are pretty much, like the rest of the planet, punching in the anorexic weight class of the energy generation manufacturing.
