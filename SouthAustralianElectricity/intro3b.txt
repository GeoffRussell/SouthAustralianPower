So how did SA come to be further along that renewable energy penetration curve than anybody else in the world (as far
as I can tell)?

## Intermittent renewable energy in South Australia 

A generous [feed in tariff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed-in_tariffs_in_Australia#South_Australia) was introduced into South Australia in 2006 with the then Premier Mike Rann aiming for the state to be carbon neutral by 2020. And now, in 2023, after 17 years of solar and wind installations, SA is a world leader in per-person wind and solar electricity generation.

Australian's simply love to use the phrase "punching above our weight", and we are. Not that we make the panels or the wind turbines or even the batteries. We are pretty much, like the rest of the planet, punching in the anorexic weight class of the renewable energy generation manufacturing; but we are pretty good at buying it and plugging it in.

The data used to compare countries below is mostly from the latest [Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review), meaning it is 2022 data from the 2023 report), but the Australian
specific and SA specific data is from [OpenNem](https://opennem.org.au/energy/nem/?range=7d&interval=30m&view=discrete-time) a terrific website which displays data from Australian electricity markets.
