## Solar power in South Australia 

South Australia is also a world leader in solar power. Estimating the amount of rooftop solar relies on installation 
data rather than actual measurement, because the generation is behind the electricity meter. Grid operators know about
the amount of solar electricity being fed into the grid, but not the amount being used in homes.

The following chart compares per per person solar PV capacity. This data is national level data; 
but includes estimates of rooftop solar. As you can see Australia has more solar capacity than any country except the 
Netherlands. Typically Australia gets about 50% more solar energy than the Netherlands, which would see our annual
panel output well above that of the Netherlands. So nationally, and at a state level, we are punching above our
weight :)
