Germany is often regarded as the global renewable energy poster child, but the Australian state of South Australia (SA)
gets almost three times the electricity per person from wind and almost three times the electricity per person from 
solar.  

The following graph is an estimation from some US [renewable energy experts](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1804705-challenges-achieving-renewable-electricity-system-united-states) (discussed more below) on the rising difficulty of implementation as variable renewables, like wind and solar, produce a larger and larger percentage of electricity on
a grid. As you can see, South Australia is getting into the area that advocates call "challenging" while others 
call "scary".
