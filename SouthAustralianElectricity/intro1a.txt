Germany is often regarded as the global renewable energy poster child,
but the Australian state of South Australia (SA) gets more than double
the electricity per person from wind and almost three times the
electricity per person from solar than Germany.


The following graph is a 2021 estimation from some US [renewable energy experts](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1804705-challenges-achieving-renewable-electricity-system-united-states) on the rising difficulty of implementation as penetration rises for variable renewables, like 
wind and solar. As you can see, South Australia, which produced 72% of its electricity from
wind and solar during the past year, is getting into the area that 
advocates call "challenging" while others call "scary".
