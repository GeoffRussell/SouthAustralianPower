### Understanding the graph

This graph was produced using the [OpenNEM website](https://opennem.org.au/energy/sa1/?range=7d&interval=5m&view=discrete-time) on the 29th of November 2023. Did I select that date because of some special attributes in
the data? No, it just happened to be when I started writing.

If you visit the OpenNEM site now, you'll see a different image, because the make up of the 
electricity supply is heavily dependent on the weather. 

The OpenNem website graph is interactive, allowing you to explore features of the data in considerable detail. But the features software designers choose to measure and highlight never cover everything. 

### Minimum amount of wind+solar 

What's the minimum amount of renewable energy during the week? OpenNem allows you to specify the granularity of the
data; 5 minutes, 30 minutes, day, week or month.
